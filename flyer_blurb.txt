	GCC Workshop: Advanced Data Visualization for manuscript figures and scientific talks
	
	In this inaugural half-day hands-on workshop, learn to use Adobe Illustrator for figure making, and 3D modeling software Blender for scientific animations.
	
	In the first section of the workshop: Attendees will learn the basics of Illustrator to go from pdfs to manuscript-ready plots following Nature Style Guidelines. You will learn how to modify panel shape, quickly recolor plots, and the design techniques to concisely and clearly support your text, all with an emphasis on maintaining data integrity.
	
	In the second section: Attendees will learn the basics of open-source, free-to-use 3D modelling software Blender. You will learn an overview of the software, including an introduction to geometry nodes and rendering. This will be used to generate animations to set your scientific talks apart. We will walk through at least two example uses, importing a 3D model of a protein from PDB, and animating a 3D UMAP from real single-cell data.
	
	February 20th 9am-1pm at Rice University BRC 280. 
	Adobe Illustrator required (usually available through institutional licenses).
	No prior experience in Illustrator or Blender necessary. 
	Free for SCO scholars, with coffee and lunch included!
	Feel free to reach out with questions to Rmulqueen@mdanderson.org
